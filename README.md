##Tech Assist
Tech Assist is a web-based consulting system with a real-time reservation system designed to provide free technical consulting services to the people of Sri Lanka. Our team of undergraduate students built this web application as our final project for the Web Module course. We focused on the SDG 17 goals and providing quality education to the community.

##The Problem
In Sri Lanka, technology is a relatively new thing for most people, and accessing it can be challenging due to financial or knowledge barriers. With the ongoing pandemic, the importance of online technology has become even more apparent, but many people are not familiar with digital devices and websites.

Some individuals take advantage of people's ignorance and sell worthless equipment at overpriced rates, giving false instructions. We identified this problem and decided to build Tech Assist as a solution.

##User-Friendly Design
We designed Tech Assist with a minimalistic approach to ensure ease of use for all users. Our color scheme consists of #000000 and #ffffff as our primary colors, with #60c1df as our secondary color. We believe this design will make it simple for people to access the help they need without feeling overwhelmed by technology.

##Heroku Platform
We used the Heroku platform to implement our web application, as GitHub PHP had some supporting errors. Our remote database is connected to Heroku. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

##Explore Tech Assist
We invite you to explore our project and see how we implemented our technical skills to create a user-friendly web application that provides a valuable service to the community.
